# WA Cubing Stats Page
This code is horrendous, haven't had time to think this through properly - will update to make things nicer, and I've got plans to add kinch and medal collection stuff here too (plus other cool stats like PR streaks).

You can find the site [here](https://joj-jh.github.io/wa_cubing_stats/).
